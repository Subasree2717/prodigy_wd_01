In this project, I designed and developed a responsive landing page featuring an interactive navigation menu. The menu's background color and font color change dynamically as the user scrolls,
providing a seamless and engaging user experience.
I Created an interactive navigation menu that changes color or style when scrolled or when hovering over a menu item. The navigation menu has a fixed position and be visible on all pages.
it also includes changing the background color or font color of the menu when it is scrolled or when a menu item is hovered over.

I have used HTML5 for structuring the navigation menu, CSS3 for styling and animating the menu and JavaScript for adding interactivity and scroll-sensitive effects

some of the Key Features are:

- Fixed-position navigation menu visible on all pages
- Dynamic color transitions on scroll and hover
- Responsive design for optimal viewing on various devices
